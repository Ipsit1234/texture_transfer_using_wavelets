# Course Project for CS 663 - Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing Autumn 2020
We had made an attempt to implement [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4420677) paper. The main idea is to use wavelet-based image fusion to transfer texture from a texture image
to a source image to generate artistic design patterns. The main program is present in `code/myMainScript.m`. Sample input images are present in `images` folder and sample output images
are present in `data` folder. Source code files are in `code` folder and a report is present in `report` folder.
